# Snake (Step 1/5): Project Scaffold

This is step 1 of a simple Snake game in Python using `pygame`.

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```zsh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```zsh
python -m src.snake.main
```

You should see a window titled "Snake" with a black background. Close the window or press `Esc`/`Q` to quit.

## Next steps

- Step 2 will add basic snake movement.
